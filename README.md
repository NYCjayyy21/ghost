DISCLAIMER
----------
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR USE IN ANY WAY THIS IS JUST A MALWARE PROJECT TO SPREAD THAT SIMILAR CODE MAY BE ENCOUNTERED AND ITS JUST TO GROW MY EXPERTISE ON THE SUBJECT THIS MEANS

- If you flag my repo to github for malicious use , it wont be my fault since this is just an experimental project also its the person who used my programs fault not mine.

- if you get in trouble because your using it thats on you


EXTRA DISCLAIMER
----------------

- Gotcha! and Gotcha!-medium are broken and can only pull some browsers and sometimes pull other
- this glitch is caused only in these two files
- i will be trying everyday to fix it and rework the other browsers


Gotcha! Overview (EXPERMIENTAL PROJECT --- NOT DONE)
----------------
Gotcha! is a set of scripts which do things like , find cookies, tokens and extremely personal files, all the way to creating worms and remotely operating a livestream on your camera and screen twenty- four seven.

Gotcha!-Original
----------------
The Original Gotcha! Script is the foundation for every other one.
it includes alot of uses but the most common are:

- shitty code some things and scripts don't work

- Cookie Logging over 10 Browsers and application.

- Includes RAT Stub as well as Gotcha! script(Experimental)

- Screenshotting/Livestreaming Camera Up to 4 Types, as well with monitor(s)

- It is very easy to modify and expand/add.

Gotcha!-XXI
-----------
The XXI variant of "Gotcha!" is our quickest one yet. at the moment it only grabs discord tokens but it is possible to do anything related to cookies.
it includes:

- Can Pass Over 60+ Antiviruses including Malwarebytes and Win Defender if obfuscation and packaging the exe is done correctly.

- Very Simple code to understand/rework ,meaning even a python beginner can understand.

- very few libraries needed meaning very fast transportation and execution.


Gotcha!-XXI-Sniper -- IN BETA
-----------
The Sniper variant of "XXI" is aimed to be put in applications and sneaked in so you can get tokens while hiding the script with an application for example gotcha - sniper was implemented into a python browser.

(Sniper is just xxi, with class and extra things to be put in an python application {might only apply with pyqt5}
(Same description as XXI)

- Can Pass Over 60+ Antiviruses including Malwarebytes and Win Defender if obfuscation and packaging the exe is done correctly.

- Very Simple code to understand/rework ,meaning even a python beginner can understand.

- very few libraries needed meaning very fast transportation and execution.

- Can be implemented into any application with ease


Gotcha!-Medium
---------------
The Medium Variant of "Gotcha!" is exactly what it means ,its a more compact version of "Gotcha!-Original" and is fixed and updated to more recent times.

- Less libraries but alot of information stolen.

- Most common one used to be rewritten and reworked.

-Overall better then the original in terms of code and speed.
