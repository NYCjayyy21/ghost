Beam or "Beamed" is an active updation fork of l-ust/beamed that im updating and making for a couple, the original tool was made by a good friend lust. , i also left his original description of the program!
<p align="">





## "beamed": tokensteal, browsersteal, & more:

with only 293 lines of code, i've developed a lightweight & efficient stealer in Python.

if you end up using this; pass a star/follow:

* Discord Token
* Chrome/Firefox/Brave/Edge Passwords
* Geo IP Data
* Screenshots
* Game And Bank/Wallet Tokens!/
* Chrome/Firefox/Brave/Edge Cookies
* IP Address

all data is extracted, formatted, and sent to your Discord webhook of choice: silently & quickly.

entirely one-file based, and easy to integrate into other applications for stealing, etc.

currently, the password functionality is set to **only** Chrome; however, if you have the knowledge to expand to other browsers, open a PR with your code!

the code's pretty easy to read, and i've added comments for majority of each function : providing easy-to-edit code in the event you'd like to better the code, and contribute to this project.

if you plan on editing this code, please:
| contributions: |
| ------------- | 
| A. Give Credit |
| B. Open a PR & become a Contributor |
| C. Use as is, and do not release the code as if it were your own. |
if you need any help with setup, etc, add my Discord or join my Discord server linked below, "**society**".

**in the above image, my cookies are set to ".ROBLOSECURITY" for ROBLOX auth. cookies => those variables are changeable.**

### requirements:

1. [Python](https://python.org) installed to "PATH"
2. IDE: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.
3. Imgur **API** Key (![Click Here](https://api.imgur.com))
4. Discord Webhook
5. Geo Ipify API Key (![Click Here](https://geo.ipify.com))

### performance:

* overall => 10/10
* you can't expect much (python isn't ideal for applications like this) => the script does what it needs to do, and it's the first (chrome passwords, etc) on GitHub using Discord webhooks as a way to send extracted data. (in Python).

| instructions |
| ------------- | 
| 1. Register for Imgur API Access |
| 2. Create a Discord Webhook |
| 3. Find lines, "164, 166, 178" |
| 4. Replace `placeholder` with your variables. |
| (extra): pack to an executable; use pyinstaller/auto-py-to-exe |
| 5. Drop to victim, make them run it. |
