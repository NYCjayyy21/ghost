Gotcha! Overview
----------------
Gotcha! is a set of scripts which do things like , find cookies, tokens and extremely personal files, all the way to creating worms and remotely operating a livestream on your camera and screen twenty- four seven.

Gotcha!-Original
----------------
The Original Gotcha! Script is the foundation for every other one.
it includes alot of uses but the most common are:

-- Cookie Logging over 10 Browsers and application.

-- Includes RAT Stub as well as Gotcha! script(Experimental)

-- Screenshotting/Livestreaming Camera Up to 4 Types, as well with monitor(s)

-- It is very easy to modify and expand/add.

Gotcha!-XXI
-----------
The XXI variant of "Gotcha!" is our quickest one yet. at the moment it only grabs discord tokens but it is possible to do anything related to cookies.
it includes:

-- Can Pass Over 60+ Antiviruses including Malwarebytes and Win Defender if obfuscation and packaging the exe is done correctly.

-- Very Simple code to understand/rework ,meaning even a python beginner can understand.

-- very few libraries needed meaning very fast transportation and execution.


Gotcha!-Medium
---------------
The Medium Variant of "Gotcha!" is exactly what it means ,its a more compact version of "Gotcha!-Original" and is fixed and updated to more recent times.

-- Less libraries but alot of information stolen.

-- Most common one used to be rewritten and reworked.

--Overall better then the original in terms of code and speed.
