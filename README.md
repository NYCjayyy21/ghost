Gotcha is a series of if you even can call it that """Malware""" which is made in python 


Gotcha has three versions


--- GOTCHA

---- GOTCHA XXI

------ GOTCHA MEDIUM



"Gotcha" is the original version with nothing cut and lots of lots bug / non-working code.

"XXI(GOTCHA)" is the 3rd Version which was meant to steal discord tokens at fast speeds and to be non detectable(only with obfuscation and exeing.)

"Medium(GOTCHA)" is the updated version with less things included and bundled and more working code.
